# Detailed Installation Guide
This is a more detailed step-by-step installation guide for EVAAA, written for users who don't have lots of experience with python dependencies, Github repositories, and/or Unity -- or in case you run into trouble with the installation.
Here we provide instructions for the installation required for the project. Make sure to follow all the necessary commands, configurations, and any additional setup required.

## Step 1. Clone EVAAA Repository
Here we provide the command to clone the main repository from GitHub to the local machine. We recommend creating a ‘root’ folder so that you can also keep your own training scripts, a Python virtual environment, and any other external EVAAA-related work in the same location.
Cloning this repository can be done either by:
- Downloading the .zip directly and extracting it into your 'root' folder
- Cloning using GitHub's command line interface

## Step 2. Install Dependencies
To run the project after replicating the repo, you must download the necessary packages in the following ways. You can install these via pip or conda, with or without a virtual environment created -- if you're more familiar with a particular method here it's probably best to stick to it.
In EVAAA, the implementation of environment and agent on Unity is based on C# and training is based on python. The way to download and set the packages needed are written at the below.

## Step 3. Download environment
You should download appropriate unity environment at this interoceptive-ai-env page.
## Step 4. Open at Unity Hub
To open your environment, you need to set Unity Editor version to ‘2021.3.1f1’. After all the packages are ready, then you can run EVAAA project at Unity.
